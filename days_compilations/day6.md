#### Topic: FUNCTIONS

##### Functions in Bash allow you to group commands into reusable units. They help in organizing code, improving readability, and reducing repetition. 

Today, I explored how to define, call, and work with functions in Bash scripts. Then wrote the scripts:

1. Bash function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string

2. A script with a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The function should use recursion.

3. A function that checks if a given number is prime. Then use this function in a script that finds all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

4. A function that takes a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the file. Use this function to analyze multiple files in a script.

5. A script with a function that generates a random password. The function should accept the password length as an argument and use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
