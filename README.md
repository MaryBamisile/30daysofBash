# 30daysofBash

### DAY 1

Clone the repo for the guide on each day: https://github.com/MaryBamisile/Linux-Projects.git

Learning achievement for day 1: 

### I created a Bash script that:
1. Creates a new directory called "my_project"
2. Changes into that directory
3. Creates three empty files named "file1.txt", "file2.txt", and "file3.txt"
4. Lists the contents of the directory
5. Prints a message saying "Project setup complete!"

### DAY 2 Learning achievement

1. Created a directory structure:
A directory called "project" in your home directory and 3 subdirectories
In each subdirectory, created an empty file called "README.md".
2. Navigation practice:

Finally, a Bash script that automates the creation of the directory structure

### DAY 3 Learning Achievements:

1. Created a script that asks for the user's name and age, stores them in variables, and then prints a greeting including this information.
![day3 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/867e8a4a-bb0e-4c9f-a94b-5c6094ab5cfa)


2. Wrote a script that takes two numbers as command-line arguments, stores them in variables, and then performs and displays the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers.

3. Created an array of my favorite books. And then a script that prints out each book on a new line, preceded by its index in the array.

4. Wrote a script that uses command substitution to get the current user, current directory, and current date/time, and prints this information in a formatted manner.
   
![day3 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4f4e7b3-8a3f-4b26-a3af-b4f9495782b7)

5. Created a script that demonstrates the use of special variables. For example, it could print the script name, the number of arguments passed to it, and all the arguments.

### DAY 4 Learning Achievements:
#### In today’s learning, I learnt about using control flow structures in making decisions in scripts and focusing on “if statements” and test commands [ ], which are fundamental to creating conditional logic in Bash scripts.

Overall, I wrote scripts to:

1️⃣ Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

2️⃣ Verify if a file exists, print its contents, or create it with default text.

3️⃣ Compare two numbers from the CLI: greater, less, or equal

4️⃣ Check if you have write permissions for a file.

5️⃣ Grant or deny access based on name & age!

### Day 5: I learnt about For and while loop used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Here are the exciting take home scripts to showcase my learning and also the versatility of Bash:

#### Highlights

1️⃣ A user-input-driven script that generates a multiplication table using a for loop.

2️⃣ Leveraging a while loop to create a simple game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

3️⃣ Using a for loop to iterate through all files in the current directory, displaying their names and sizes—a handy tool for file management. 

![day5 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6be10337-a2a1-41fe-81a1-308f63f0287b)

4️⃣ A while loop-based script to compute the factorial of any user-inputted number. Great for mathematical enthusiasts! 

![day5 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd8dc094-6324-4f86-92bc-084be14f63b4)

5️⃣ Nested for loops to generate a complete multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5—a practical approach to structured data representation.

These exercises have not only strengthened my understanding of loops, conditionals, and command-line tools but also highlighted how scripting can simplify complex tasks.
