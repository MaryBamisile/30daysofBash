# 30daysofBash

### DAY 1

Clone the repo for the guide on each day: https://github.com/MaryBamisile/Linux-Projects.git

Learning achievement for day 1: 

### I created a Bash script that:
1. Creates a new directory called "my_project"
2. Changes into that directory
3. Creates three empty files named "file1.txt", "file2.txt", and "file3.txt"
4. Lists the contents of the directory
5. Prints a message saying "Project setup complete!"
